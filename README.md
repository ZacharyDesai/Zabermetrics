## College Football

### Entire Season Simulation (Live Updates) + Standings, Rankings, Playoffs, etc.

Curious how the season will turn out - at any point in the season? The following spreadsheet simulates the entire college football season (or what remains of it), according to team ratings computed by formulas. By the end of the season, standings are generated, and then conference championships and the College Football Playoff are simulated. Everything is programmed, except for the rankings, which adds a nice subjective, human touch to make the simulation more realistic.

## NFL Draft

### NFL Draft LIVE Simulator

Curious about who each team is eyeing throughout the draft? The following spreadsheet not only simulates the NFL Draft, but it also displays the top prospects each team is eyeing. The best part? The spreadsheet updates after each actual pick of the draft, so the top prospects for each team are continuously updated throughout the draft. Each team evaluates available prospects using a combination of overall prospect ratings and their team needs, which update after each selection they make.
