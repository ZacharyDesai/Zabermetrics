## NFLDraft.js

### NFL Draft LIVE Simulator + Prospect Grades

Curious about who each team is eyeing throughout the draft? This simulator, which is updated live throughout the NFL Draft, displays a list of top available prospects for each team's pick and simulates who each team will pick for all 7 rounds. Viewers are free to follow along live throughout the draft. The top prospects are based off their draft value according to analysts (their projected rounds), their high school and college success (primarily college statistics and awards, with high school recruiting grades taken into account), and their derived athleticism (using measurements of a prospect's size, speed, explosion, and agility), in roughly a 50%-25%-25% split, respectively.
